# freeCodeCampWork
repository showing progress of completed free code camp lessons.  

set up a local environment of the free code camp curiculum. 
step by step instructions can be found here:
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md

Unfortunately, the completed lessons on the free code camp local environment do not count towards contributions on github. 
This repository is to document progress completed on the free code camp lessons and to get my github green.

I am starting with responsive web design certificate. With using the local environment, tracking on freecodecamp.org is not possible, but I am still able to claim certification. This however might be tricky to prove my work, since it is not tracked on the website.
